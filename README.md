Meme Generator
Objective
Due to an unusually selective solar flare, nearly all of the internet's memes and memecentric applications were lost late last night. Don't google it, just trust me. It's up to us to create the application that will fuel the impending meme renaissance.

Tasks
We will use React to create a Single Page Applciation (SPA) that will allow us to select a base image from a list of options and then lay custom text over the image. Finally, the user will be able to download the finalized image so they can share it on their favorite irc channels.
